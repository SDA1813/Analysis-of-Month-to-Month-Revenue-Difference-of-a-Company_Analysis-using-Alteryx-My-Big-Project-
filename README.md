# Analysis-of-Month-to-Month-Revenue-Difference-of-a-Company_Analysis-using-Alteryx-My-Big-Project-

You work at a company that provides a variety of products and services to customers. Your manager has recently asked you to create a snapshot report that shows the month-to-month revenue for all of the company's customers. 

You have been given two Accounts Receivable registers, one for November and one for December, and your task is to prepare these files and join them together.

Your manager is particularly interested in understanding any changes in revenue from month to month, so you have been asked to highlight any customers whose total invoice amount has changed by more than $1 million from one month to the next. By completing this problem set, you will be able to provide your manager with a clear and accurate view of the company's revenue over the past two months, and help identify any customers who may be experiencing significant changes in their revenue. This information will be valuable in helping the company make informed decisions about its business and future strategy.


{Project Alomst done} Need to change the months and run the dataset with new values to test the Workflow.
Documentation will be shortely provided.
Reporting data need to be improved. I will also try to connect the output to power BI for reporting other than Alteryx reporting.
